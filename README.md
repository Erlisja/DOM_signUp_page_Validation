# DOM_signUp_page_Validation

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive form validation script that ensures the integrity and quality of user-submitted data through various checks and visual feedback. The project incorporates multiple web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and custom alerts.

## Features
- **Custom Form Validation**: Validates the `username`, `password`, `confirm password`, and other required form fields.
- **Password Strength Checker**: Displays password strength with a dynamic progress bar.
- **Custom Alert Window**: Shows custom alert messages for specific validation errors.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Highlights form fields with color-coded borders based on their validation status.
- **Real-Time Attribute Modification**: Modifies form field attributes dynamically based on user input.
- **Browser Object Model (BOM) Usage**: Demonstrates the use of BOM properties and methods.

## Requirements

[x] Cache at least one element using selectElementById. <br>
[x] Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll. <br>
[x] Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).  <br>
[x] Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.  <br>
[x] Create at least one element using createElement.  <br>
[x] Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.  <br>
[x] Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.  <br>
[x] Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.  <br>
[x] Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.  <br>
[x] Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.  <br>
[x] Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.  <br>
[x] Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.  <br>
[x] Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)  <br>

## How to Run
1. Include the provided `script.js` in your HTML file.
2. Ensure that the form in your HTML has the necessary `id` and `class` attributes to match the script's selectors.
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the validation in action.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the form
- **CSS**: Basic styling and visual feedback
- **JavaScript**: Client-side logic for validation, event handling, and DOM manipulation
